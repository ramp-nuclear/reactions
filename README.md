# Reactions
Welcome to the Reactions package! This package defines a core concept of nuclear reactions, where isotopes transmute into other isotopes by absorbing or emitting particles.

This package is used to define what are mostly data classes, that contain nuclear information about these reactions, such as how much energy is released when they occur or the information about emitted particles.
