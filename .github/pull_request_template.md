# Description
Describe the purpose of this pull request.
What is the problem that we're trying to fix, and what is the solution about.

For example:
> There is a bug where deserializing a Reaction creates a new target Isotope entity separate from the original serialized object. This pull request fixes that, so the singleton behavior is maintained in this case.

If this discussion already appears on an issue that this pull request is meant to solve, that's even better! In that case, a short sentence such as the following suffices:
> This pull request solves issue #5 as decided in that discussion. See the discussion therein.

# Tests
Please describe tests that you added or changed to ensure that things behave correctly. This will ensure that we don't regress on this issue in the future.

For example:
> I added a test called `test_serialize_deserialize` that takes a specific Reaction with a target Isotope, serializes and deserializes it with `pickle`, and ensures the result target is the same object with an `is` assertion.
